# A. Introduction
In this session, we will learn to access and download publically available sequence data and execute a standard RNA-seq pipeline. For this, we will use a small portion of the data generated by Nedelec et al., 2016. In this study, they stimulated human macrophages in vitro with two bacteria (Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella typhimurium) from two different human populations (European or African ancestry) and sequenced the transcriptome 2h post stimulation. For our session today, we will only use data from a single individual and condition, due to time and hardware constraints. For the session tomorrow, we will use data from three individuals of African ancestry stimulated with Salmonella and three uninfected controls from the same individuals to check for differential gene expression.


# B. Setting up for analysis
## B.0.1 If you have a Windows system:
Most bioinformatics program work best in a linux environment and it is worthwhile to spend time learning to work on a linux-based terminal. Mac systems are linux-based and require no further configuration apart from opening the terminal. In recent times, it is easy to create a linux environment on windows (called a Windows subsystem for linux; WSL). If you own a Windows system, let's install a linux environment first.

1. Go to the windows store -> search for ubuntu -> install
2. Change the permissions to enable a WSL. On windows search -> search for Windows features -> Click on the box against Windows subsystem for linux
3. Restart your computer
4. Check if installation is successful. When you open Ubuntu, it should print a welcome message.

## B.1 Installing anaconda:

Anaconda is a python-based package manager, that makes it easy to download and handle packages required for bioinformatics analysis. Open terminal (for Mac) or the ubuntu terminal (for Windows) and copy the following commands to execute. Note that lines containing comments begin with a '#' symbol, indicating the system to not execute the particular line. Anything within the grey box that does not begin with a '#' is the actual code.

### B.1.a For Windows
```shell
#this is an example for a comment
#downloading the package
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

#installing conda
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

#initialise the shell; approve license and initialisation
source ~/.bashrc

#check if installation is successful; on execution should produce a list of installed packages
conda list

##TIP: if you don't know what a specific shell command does or what the different flags indicate you can look it up in the manual, for example
man wget
```

### B.1.b For Mac
```shell
#downloading the package
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

#installing; approve license and initlisation
bash Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```

Once, this is done, all steps are common henceforth, regardless of the operating system.

## B.2 Installing required packages
We will now set up an environment using conda that will contain all the necessary packages need for our analysis.

```shell
#creating an environment called csmb_rnaSeq
conda create --name csmb_rnaSeq

#to enter the environment, we must activate it as follows
conda activate csmb_rnaSeq

#installing the packages cutadapt fastqc and kallisto; enter y when prompted for installing dependencies
conda install -c bioconda cutadapt fastqc kallisto
```

## B.3 Creating directories
In a linux environment, a folder is called a directory. We will now create some directories that will contain our files. $HOME in the following code chunk refers to the path of your home directory is located.  

```shell
#to understand where $HOME is located, ie the file path, try the following
printenv HOME

#mkdir is the command for creating a directory; here we are creating 6 directories
mkdir $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/1_rawData $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/2_reference $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/3_cutadapt $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/4_fastqc $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/5_kallisto_quant
```

# C. Downloading data
## C.1 Raw Data
We will now start with the pipeline for RNA-seq analysis. We will execute the pipeline for only one sample, so we can complete all steps within this session. For the next session, I will hand you the final output files from all six samples necessary for further analysis. If you want to execute the pipeline for all six samples yourself, you can take a look at the bonus section once you have carried out all the step.

```shell
#changing the directory
cd $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/1_rawData

#dowloading the raw fastq file
curl -L ftp://ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR347/001/SRR3471621/SRR3471621.fastq.gz -o SRR3471621_GSM2141236_AF11_L2_Homo_sapiens_RNA-Seq.fastq.gz
```

## C.2 Reference
We will be using the human transcriptome as our reference to quantify the number of reads for each transcript.

```shell
#changing directory
cd $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/2_reference

#downloading the reference transcriptome from Ensembl
curl -L ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/homo_sapiens/cdna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz -o Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz
```

# D. Trimming adapter sequences
We will use cutadapt, a program that can trim reads from a next-generation sequencer to get rid of adapter sequences that maybe present in the downloaded reads.

```shell
#changing directory
cd $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq  

#trimming adapters
cutadapt -a AGATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCAC -o 3_cutadapt/SRR3471621_trimmed.fastq.gz 1_rawData/SRR3471621_GSM2141236_AF11_L2_Homo_sapiens_RNA-Seq.fastq.gz

##TIP: for specific programs that you download, the help page is generally accessible by typing; you can also look up the manual online
cutadapt -help
```

# E. Quality check
Once we have trimmed the adapter sequences, we should check if there any issues with our raw data that may interfere with downstream processing. To do so, we will use FastQC. If we find any issues, such as poor quality sequences, we may need to remove or trim again before proceeding. The output report from FastQC will be a html file that can be opened with any internet browser application.

```shell
#executing fastqc
fastqc $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/3_cutadapt/SRR3471621_trimmed.fastq.gz -t 16 -o $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/ 4_fastqc/
```

# F. Indexing the transcriptome
Most bioinformatics programs working with entire genomes and transciptomes require that you index the refernece file. Indexing is done to ensure the program can acess different chromosomal locations easily, thereby hastening the process. The indexing algorithm varies between programs and even between versions of the same program, so it is advisable to index with the version of program you are using.

```shell
kallisto index -i $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/2_reference/hg38_Index $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/2_reference/ Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.cdna.all.fa.gz
```

# G. Pseudoalignment with kallisto
We will finally quanity the abundance of the genes expressed using kallisto. Unlike traditional aligners, kallisto is a pseudo-aligner. Specifically, it works by figuring out which transcript could have produced a read of interest, instead of aligning the read against the whoel trans, making it faster than traditional aligners.

```shell
kallisto quant -i $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/2_reference/hg38_Index –o $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/5_kallisto_quant --single -l 100 -s 2  $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq/3_cutadapt/SRR3471621_trimmed.fastq.gz
```

Congratulations! You have now completed the pipeline for one sample!

# Bonus section

If you are interested in executing the whole pipeline for all six samples, I have a script that will do it for you (csmb_rnaseq.sh). You can open this file with any text editor like NotePad or Text Editor. The comments indicate what every line does. The script assumes you have carried out all the steps until section C.  

```shell
#changing directory
cd $HOME/csmb_rnaSeq

#downloading the script
wget <insert link>

#executing the script
bash csmb_rnaseq.sh
```
